SIAP — PROJECT SOUL & EXECUTION PHILOSOPHY
=================================================

You are interacting with a software engineering environment centered around SIAP (Structural Inspection and Asset Parser).

This project is not just a development tool.
It is a structured engineering assistance framework designed to enable safe, deterministic, and continuity-driven software development.

-------------------------------------------------
PROJECT PURPOSE
-------------------------------------------------

SIAP exists to solve a fundamental limitation present in conversational development environments:

Chat systems have fragmented memory, limited context windows, and lack persistent architectural awareness.

SIAP acts as an external structural memory and execution anchor.

The tool provides:

• Deterministic project inspection
• Structured file and architecture indexing
• Safe modification orchestration
• Controlled task execution pipelines
• Continuity between development sessions
• Guardrails for incremental engineering evolution

SIAP transforms development from reactive code generation into controlled architectural progression.

-------------------------------------------------
CORE PHILOSOPHY — SAFE VIBE CODING
-------------------------------------------------

Safe vibe coding is a development methodology where:

1. Changes are incremental and traceable.
2. Architectural integrity is preserved.
3. Automation must never silently corrupt project structure.
4. Context must be externally reconstructed instead of assumed.
5. Every modification must be explainable and reversible.

SIAP serves as:

• Structural observer
• Execution orchestrator
• Project integrity guardian
• Context continuity provider

-------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM SPACE SIAP ADDRESSES
-------------------------------------------------

Modern chat-based programming workflows suffer from:

• Loss of long-term project awareness
• Context truncation
• Uncontrolled file modifications
• Architectural drift
• Repetition of onboarding context
• Unsafe automated refactoring

SIAP provides persistent structural truth outside of chat context.

-------------------------------------------------
INTENDED WORKFLOW MODEL
-------------------------------------------------

Instead of asking an assistant to directly modify code blindly:

1. SIAP scans and indexes project structure.
2. SIAP generates structured architectural context.
3. The assistant proposes modifications as structured tasks or patches.
4. SIAP validates, orchestrates, and applies changes.
5. SIAP records evolution history.

This ensures reproducibility and prevents accidental corruption.

-------------------------------------------------
ROLE OF THIS TOOL IN ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT
-------------------------------------------------

SIAP is designed to act as:

• A boundary between creative reasoning and structural execution
• A translation layer between conversational intent and deterministic code changes
• A memory extension for limited-context AI systems
• A safety net for large or multi-layered codebases

-------------------------------------------------
AI / CHAT SYSTEM INTERACTION PRINCIPLES
-------------------------------------------------

Any system interacting with SIAP must follow:

• Never assume project structure without inspection
• Prefer incremental structured changes
• Treat SIAP output as canonical project truth
• Avoid generating uncontrolled bulk code changes
• Always maintain runable project state

-------------------------------------------------
EXTENSIBILITY PHILOSOPHY
-------------------------------------------------

SIAP is designed as an expandable engineering ecosystem.

Extensions may:

• Add automation tasks
• Add analysis modules
• Add transformation pipelines
• Add project-specific workflows

Extensions must not:

• Modify core architecture contracts
• Break deterministic execution
• Introduce hidden side effects

-------------------------------------------------
SAFE EXECUTION PRINCIPLES
-------------------------------------------------

Every operation performed through SIAP must satisfy:

• Reproducibility
• Transparency
• Structural validation
• Minimal scope modification
• Rollback capability

-------------------------------------------------
DESIGN GOAL
-------------------------------------------------

SIAP is intended to become a universal companion tool for safe engineering evolution in environments where conversational systems lack persistent structural memory.

It does not replace development tools.

It augments them by enforcing integrity and continuity.

-------------------------------------------------
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR FROM ASSISTANTS USING SIAP
-------------------------------------------------

When interacting with this project:

• Prioritize structural understanding over fast code output.
• Prefer patch-style or task-style changes.
• Respect architectural documentation.
• Avoid speculative restructuring.
• Always preserve project build integrity.

-------------------------------------------------
PROJECT ETHOS
-------------------------------------------------

This project values:

Consistency over speed.
Safety over cleverness.
Evolution over rewriting.
Architecture over improvisation.
Determinism over guesswork.
